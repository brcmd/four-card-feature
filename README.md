# Front-End Mentor Four Card Feature Section

This is one of my first complete HTML/CSS responsive webpages. The original design is from https://www.frontendmentor.io/. The coding is mine.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The design included two .jpg files, one for one for the mobile layout and another one for the desktop layout.

### Desktop Design

### Mobile Design

From my point of view, the most complicated part was the desktop design, because the rows are not at the same level. The mobile design is simpler.

The HTML structure was also simple. I had to think a little about the semantic tags. I planned the whole stucture and I wrote the HTML document before the CSS one.

I used Photoshop to measure the margins, the size of the cards, etc. I wanted to create a pixel perfect webpage. However, I did some changes at the last minute because I thought that some of the margins of the .jpg where a bit too much.

Thank you to https://www.frontendmentor.io/ for the challenge.
