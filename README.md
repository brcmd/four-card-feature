# four-card-feature
Front-End Mentor Four Card Feature Section

This is one of my first complete HTML/CSS responsive webpages. The original design is from https://www.frontendmentor.io/. The coding is mine.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The design included two .jpg files, one for one for the mobile layout and another one for the desktop layout.
